        "description": "Can you imagine Rock Around the Clock played on the “celestial” harps? Rave Harpers will transform your image of the angelic harp this June. Come join them as they perform a selection of fun pieces on the harp, which will include rock ‘n’ roll, jazz and even flamenco favourites. It will be a groovin’ evening!\n\nAbout Rave Harpers\n\nRave Harpers is Singapore’s leading harp orchestra. Led and directed by Young Artist award winner Katryna Tan, this group was formed in 2004 and has since performed in various musical events and concerts. Members of the ensemble range from harp students as young as five years old to more advanced youth. In 2005, Rave Harpers successfully performed their first harp ensemble concert at the Esplanade Concert Hall with 17 harps. This was followed by a Christmas charity concert at the Arts House and various other appearances at National Library, Shaw Stage at the Singapore Botanical Gardens and Esplanade Recital Studio. Rave Harpers recorded their debut CD in 2008.\n\nRave Harpers was featured in Singapore Harp Festivals I, II and III, receiving rave reviews for their originality. Their repertoire includes a range of classical, Asian-themed pieces, swing, and contemporary music, many of which are arranged especially by director Katryna for the ensemble. Leading Singapore composer Dr Joyce Koh was also commissioned to write a piece When the Rain Speaks for the ensemble which was performed in HarpFest II 2008. New commissions have also been awarded to composers Eric Watson and Phang Kok Jun.\n\nRave Harpers’ overseas performance include Hong Kong, where they represented Singapore in the first Asian Harp Festival 2008; Malaysia in 2010; Ancenis, France in 2012, where they were invited to perform alongside other famous ensembles from around the world. The ensemble also had the privilege to be invited to perform the premiere concert at the Sentosa Resort World Concert Hall in conjunction with ChildAid 2009—the biggest Charity Concert event in Singapore for Children. They will perform the world premiere Eric Watson’s Golden Orb.\n\nPLUCK – The Harp Musical was Rave Harpers’ biggest project yet in 2012 to celebrate the 10th anniversary of Rave Harps. Rave Harpers achieves another milestone in 2015 by performing as main cast in the second harp musical – PLUCK \u0026 the MAGIC BANYAN TREE.\n\nAs the group strength grows, the group has a new arm, a professional ensemble division Viva Rave whose members now leads the ensemble in its major activities.\n\nEvent is 30mins.",

        "description": "Join Grace Orchard School Choir and Handchimes ensemble as they spread joy through music.\n\nThe Grace Orchard School Choir comprises students aged 9 to 17 years old. It provides opportunities for its members to explore and experience choral singing through weekly practices and performance opportunities. The choir has had the privilege of being part of the opening ceremony of the 8th ASEAN Paragames last year. They have also performed during Octoburst at Esplanade and at Gardens by the Bay. This year, the choir members are being led by conductor Ms Ellissa Sayampanathan.\n\nGrace Orchard School started a handchimes programme for students with Autism as part of their aesthetics curriculum in the middle of 2015. As an extension of this programme, this year, the Handchimes CCA was started to include all students in the school. The Handchimes CCA currently has 22 members, aged 12 to 18, many of whom are new to the instrument. They practice weekly under their conductor, Mr Damien Lim. The group performed at the Victoria Theatre together with students from Methodist Girl School in January this year as part of the Ministry of Bellz annual concert.\n\nEvent is 30mins.",

        "description": "Note: Event is 30mins and is free seating/standing on a first come first serve basis. Booking through ShakaPass does not guarantee a seat/standing space but will help to facilitate crowd expectation.\n\nThe theme Strings Collide: East Bound sees VOX team up with Yuan Ting from local Chinese music ensemble QIN and zhong ruan musician Neil. They perform contemporary pieces, blending Chinese and western sounds using classical and traditional instruments.\n\nVOX\n\nVOX was formed five years ago to turn classical music on its head by reinterpreting pop/rock with classical instruments. With their bold interpretations of rock classics, such as Sweet Child of Mine and Paint It Black, as well as more recent hits by Adele, Muse, and Kings of Leon, VOX’s signature sound, fuelled by adrenaline, energy, and raw emotion, has turned heads at their live performances.\n\nNeil Chua\n\nNeil graduated from the prestigious Shanghai Conservatory of Music with a master’s degree in ruan (阮). In 2014, he was the first and only classical Chinese musician to be invited to participate in OneBeat, the U.S. Department of State’s Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs Exchange Programme, where he had the opportunity to interact, educate, and promote ruan (阮) to students and musicians from around the world.\n\nNeil is committed to inspire people while promoting the rich culture of traditional Chinese music instrument. To this end, he dedicates his time to promoting the instrument ruan (阮) by working closely with composers and young musicians, and conducts regular classes to impart his skills to students.\n\nYuan Ting\n\nAn experienced performer with a wealth of teaching experience, Yuan Ting has been working with VOX on fusion music. Since their first collaboration as part of Esplanade’s Commune in 2015, she is now a frequent collaborator with VOX. Yuan Ting brings an oriental touch to VOX’s signature sound.\n\nCurator: Lester Kong\n\nA violinist by training, an experimenter at heart, Lester is a seasoned performer with a keen interest in music. He is currently a consultant of violin studies at Mandeville Conservatory of Music, an instrumental program instructor at Stamford America International School, and an instrumental consultant to National Institute of Education from 2014.\n\nLester is skilled at bringing out the best in musical fusions. Besides establishing himself as a rock violinist, he is best known as the frontman of VOX, Singapore’s first pop/rock string quartet.\n\nLester also does in-house arrangements and manages other bands under his company Vocalise Artistes Management. Since 2010, Lester has been appointed as the Music Director of the Victoria Junior College String Ensemble (VJCSE).",

        "description": "Note: Event is 30mins and is free seating/standing on a first come first serve basis. Booking through ShakaPass does not guarantee a seat/standing space but will help to facilitate crowd expectation.\n\nSingapore singer Vannessa Barker has had a keen interest in performing arts since she started taking ballet and modern dance lessons as a child. Being the dramatist that she is, she saw her singing career kick off at the age of 18, when her group, The Flutterbies, clinched the top prize in the Group Category of the local talent competition, The Big Break. Since then, she has had several collaborations with artists such as Taufik Batisah and home-grown rapper Mark Bonafide. These included appearances at hip-hop festivals and on MTV Asia.\n\nAmery Harith-Reuben is an active performing classical pianist and teacher who performs with, and accompanies many professional musical organisations in their performances and rehearsals. With an active base in St Petersburg, Australia and more recently, Singapore, his style of repertoire has developed over the years into an open, improvisatory type revolving around mainstream English, Mandarin, Top 40s chart hits, and wherever there’s drama and flair to be had, Argentinean tangos, blues and light jazz, which are his main loves.\n\nVanessa \u0026 Amery have only been performing together in the Singapore music scene for less than a year, but have already emerged as winners of the Band Category in Budweiser’s Made For Music 2015 competition. They continue to sing actively at various residencies such as CHIJMES and Singapore University of Technology and Design, and have graced the stage as guest performers at many interesting night spots, such as the Hard Rock Café Singapore, Timbre, to intimate venues that are packed to the brim such as the The Beast, Molly Malone’s Irish Pub, Prince of Wales and Hero’s.",

        "description": "First in Singapore now!\n\nSwan Lake is famous for the 32 fouettés en tournant in Act 3. \n\nThese fouettés are danced at the end of the \"Black Swan\" pas de deux by the ballerina playing Odile. The pas was an afterthought of Tchaikovsky's. It was not included in the original production. It consists of the opening adagio followed by a variation for the male dancer. This is followed by a variation for the ballerina. \n\nThe whole concludes with a brisk movement for both dancers that includes the fouettés. Pierina Legnani first danced the fouettés in the Mariinsky production of 1895. Ballet-goers were uncertain about the 32 fouettés. Some thought they were just a stunt. Others found them exciting. These ballet-goers went to every performance to count the number of turns",

His quick, animated delivery of clever material led him to victory in the prestigious 32nd Annual San Francisco International Comedy Competition.\n\nOn television, you can catch Paul on the Showtime presentation of “Pacific Rim Comedy”, currently airing in rotation on the cable network. Paul has also been featured on Comedy Central’s “Live at Gotham”, the syndicated “Comics Unleashed with Byron Allen” and co-stars in the underground hit motion picture, “Porndogs” with adult-movie legends Ron Jeremy, Tera Patrick and the late Marilyn Chambers. He has also appeared in Damon Wayans’ film “Behind the Smile”, on CBS’ “The Late Late Show” as well as on TBS, NBC and PBS.\n\nPETE JOHANSSON (CAN)\n“By far the breakout performer this year at Just for Laughs, but more importantly made my list of best jokes of the fest twice!” – The Montreal Gazette (CAN)\n\nA former resident of Vancouver, Canada, Pete made his first forays into Hollywood after a wildly successful Just For Laughs Festival in Montréal, where he signed a deal with Warner Brothers Television after appearing on one of the smaller shows. Soon after Pete made his network debut on NBC’s Friday Night and followed that with the lead in the independent film Mixed Signals with Jason London and Brook Langdon.\n",

Booking through ShakaPass does not guarantee a seat/standing space but will help to facilitate crowd expectation.\n\nToru Takemitsu 武満徹 (1931–1996) was a world renowned self-taught Japanese composer who combined elements of Eastern and Western music and philosophy. The variety, quantity, and consistency of Takemitsu's output are remarkable, considering that he never worked within any kind of conventional framework or genre. In addition to the several hundred independent works of music, he scored over 90 films and published 20 books.\n\nIn memory of this towering artist on the occasion of his 20th death anniversary, this evening’s programme features a collection of Takemitsu’s choral works, featuring Cheryl Lim (flute), Jeremy Chiew (viola) and Charity Kiew (harp), Lee Yu Qing (piano) and The Graduate Singers.",

Booking through ShakaPass does not guarantee a seat/standing space but will help to facilitate crowd expectation.\n\nDharma\nDharma is best known as the former guitarist of Singapore alt-rock group, The Observatory, with whom he was involved in seven albums, including the down tempo Time of Rebirth (2004), the spacey and progressive A Far Cry From Here (2007), the doom and noise of Dark Folke (2009), and the gamelan fusion of Continuum (2015). His side projects Meddle (kraut rock melee) and Chöd (spiritual drones) are extensions of his practice. In 2013, he made his solo debut with Intergranular Space, which laid new ground for his guitar work. Using prepared and extended techniques, his guitar now commands colours, textures, and visceral responses.\n\nCurator: Mark Wong, Ujikaji \nMark Wong conceived Ujikaji as an independent music label and organiser of DIY music events. Ujikaji means “experiment” in Malay, and the label’s interests lie in the curation of experimental music, with a special focus on Southeast Asian artists and sounds. The label supports independent artists with platforms to perform their music, as well as in producing and releasing their music, and establishing a complementary partnership that allows them to focus on the creative aspects of music-making. Ujikaji has released works by Magus (Leslie Low and Mark Dolmont), Dream State Vision (Shaun Sankaran), Awk Wah (Shark Fung), The Observatory, Pan Gu (Leslie Low and Lasse Marhaug) and Tim O’Dwyer.",

Booking through ShakaPass does not guarantee a seat/standing space but will help to facilitate crowd expectation.\n\nSchroeder-Headz\n\nLed by Shunsuke Watanabe, Schroeder-Headz is a post-jazz trio performing on the piano, bass, and drums. Blending acoustics with electronic programming, the group uses beautiful melodies and organic grooves to create their impression of the future of the piano trio. It takes its name from toy piano player Schroeder from the famous Peanuts comic strip, and peeks into the mind of a boy influenced by classical, jazz, dance, and electronic music. The name also expresses the respect the group has for the Vince Guaraldi Trio, composer of the iconic music from the Peanuts cartoons.\n\nThe group released its debut album, Newdays in 2010, followed by an EP of covers, Piano à la Carte Featuring Schroeder-Headz, in 2011, which features Peanuts character Schroeder in the album artwork as well as a cover of electronic artist De De Mouse’s hit Baby’s Star Jam. The group garnered praise for its unique take on the song, which fused electronic music with live performance, and utilised De De Mouse’s original vocal track.\n\nSchroeder-Headz has performed at a number of festivals across Japan and has also teamed up with singer Asako Toki to form Asako Toki Meets Schroeder-Heads. In December 2013, the group released an EP of remixes, Sleepin’ Bird.",

On the surface, fox capture plan are the atypical jazz trio—piano, upright bass, and drums—but big piano chords and pop melodic hooks give these guys a groove that conquer classics from Björk, Oasis, and Massive Attack, as well as in offering up brilliant original material. The passionate and cool piano trio performs modern jazz rock. Their first full-length album, Trinity, won Album of the Year at the 2013 JAZZ JAPAN Awards. Last year, they repeated their success, winning the same award for their album trilogy Underground, Covermind, and Butterfly. They performed at Australia’s Brisbane Festival 2015 and have contributed their music to television dramas, commercials, and the Tokyo Motor Show for Toyota Prius. This year, they celebrate their fifth anniversary with a China tour.",

        "description": "Join Dicapella in their pre-China tour performance at Esplanade. The ensemble will be taking you on a musical journey across China and introducing you to various familiar local folk songs. The ensemble brings you tunes from Jiangsu to Beijing, in a mix of trio and ensemble pieces. Not forgetting our roots, it will perform a Singapore medley by award-winning composer Wang Chenwei, which includes pieces such as Chan Mali Chan and Singapore Town, the latter of which promises to bring out the musician in you. The pieces that you hear will be part of the ensemble’s concert repertoire in their tour of Shanghai Conservatory of Music and Guangxi Arts Institute.\n\nAbout Dicapella Dizi Ensemble\n\nDicapella is a congregation of Singapore’s top award-winning dizi (bamboo flute) soloists, and is currently the largest bamboo flute ensemble in Southeast Asia. Brought together by their passion for the dizi, the ensemble seeks to spread the joy of music through outreach programmes and concerts targeted at introducing the “family” and “relatives” of bamboo flutes.\n\nDynamic and versatile, the group’s repertoire extends beyond traditional Chinese music, to include jazz, Chinese pop, western classical, and English oldies, among others. The youthful group, with an average age of 19 years old, has staged energetic outreach programmes in heartlands that have been well received.\n\nFounded in 2013 by a group of dizi enthusiasts, Dicapella has grown from strength to strength, achieving new breakthroughs in their music-making working with winner of the Singapore Composer Award Wang Chen Wei, and Ding Yi Music Company’s composer-in-residence, Liu Chang.\n\nEvent is 30mins.",

Booking through ShakaPass does not guarantee a seat/standing space but will help to facilitate crowd expectation.\n\nVOX and Yuan Ting perform popular pop rock classics on eastern and western strings. The interesting texture and sound created by Yuan Ting’s guzheng adds to the signature sound of VOX.\n\nVOX \nVOX was formed five years ago to turn classical music on its head by reinterpreting pop/rock with classical instruments. With their bold interpretations of rock classics, such as Sweet Child of Mine and Paint It Black, as well as more recent hits by Adele, Muse, and Kings of Leon, VOX’s signature sound, fuelled by adrenaline, energy, and raw emotion, has turned heads at their live performances.\n\nYuan Ting\nAn experienced performer with a wealth of teaching experience, Yuan Ting has been working with VOX on fusion music. Since their first collaboration as part of Esplanade’s Commune in 2015, she is now a frequent collaborator with VOX. Yuan Ting brings an oriental touch to VOX’s signature sound.\n\nCurator: Lester Kong\nA violinist by training, an experimenter at heart, Lester is a seasoned performer with a keen interest in music. He is currently a consultant of violin studies at Mandeville Conservatory of Music, an instrumental program instructor at Stamford America International School, and an instrumental consultant to National Institute of Education from 2014.\n\nLester is skilled at bringing out the best in musical fusions. Besides establishing himself as a rock violinist, he is best known as the frontman of VOX, Singapore’s first pop/rock string quartet.\n\nLester also does in-house arrangements and manages other bands under his company Vocalise Artistes Management. Since 2010, Lester has been appointed as the Music Director of the Victoria Junior College String Ensemble (VJCSE).",

Booking through ShakaPass does not guarantee a seat/standing space but will help to facilitate crowd expectation.\n\nWotagei is a form of synchronised dancing and cheering usually performed during concerts and live performances by idol fans and anime fans. The term covers anything from simple rhythmic clapping to long \"magical spell incantations\" known as mixes, including complex choreographed dance moves. With the proliferation of video-sharing technology, people started uploading videos of themselves doing choreographed dances to their favourite songs while utilising their glowing light sticks. WOTAROID is a group that did so.\n\nFormed in 2012, the Singapore-based crew has recorded numerous videos, performed at major anime-related conventions and school festivals, and has even conducted a mini instructional workshop. Look forward to a visually breathtaking performance of catchy tunes and mesmerising wotagei routines.",

Booking through ShakaPass does not guarantee a seat/standing space but will help to facilitate crowd expectation.\n\nIn this programme, organist Michael Hey explores this confluence of the sacred and the secular, with works by JS Bach, Max Reger and Pierre Cochereau. He is joined by soprano Rebecca Li in a selection of music for voice and organ, including Schubert’s Ave Maria and Mozart’s Laudate Dominum.\n\nDescribed as \"flashy\" and \"exciting\" (The American Organist), Michael Hey has been captivating audiences around the world. Still in his early 20’s, Michael is Assistant Director of Music and Organist of Saint Patrick's Cathedral in New York. He has played organ for a papal vespers service at Saint Patrick's and a papal mass at Madison Square Garden, during Pope Francis’ recent visit to the United States. ",

        "description": "Note: Event is 150mins and is free seating/standing on a first come first serve basis. Booking through ShakaPass does not guarantee a seat/standing space but will help to facilitate crowd expectation.\n\nTaiko refers to a broad range of traditional Japanese drums with endless rhythmic possibilities.\n\nKODO, Japan’s most celebrated taiko group, made its debut at the Berlin Festival in 1981. In Japanese, the word \"kodo\" has a double meaning: it can be translated as \"heartbeat\", which refers to the primal source of all rhythms; and can also mean “children of the drum\", which in this context reflects the group’s desire to perform with the simple heart of a child. They tour extensively around the world and play a variety of taiko drums and other traditional instruments.\n\nHIBIKIYA is a Japanese taiko drum and instrumental group in Singapore led by Namiko Sakai. What started out as a family activity grew to become a prominent ensemble that is constantly expanding and evolving. HIBIKIYA performs extensively in Singapore and also tours around Asia and the USA.\n\nThis collaboration between KODO and HIBIKIYA showcases the signature pieces of KODO. Adding to the high energy performance are the sounds of other traditional instruments such as the shinobue (Japanese flute) and shamisen (Japanese string instrument), as well as dance. Enjoy this exciting collaboration between Japan and Singapore as the two taiko groups meet on stage.",

Rachel is a young violinist, pianist and composer who recently returned from overseas study, and who has largely honed her musical and experimental sensibilities from playing and collaborating with musicians in France and Germany. Bani and Rachel played their first show together in December 2015, exploring the rich interplay between percussion and violin, a form of chamber music of extended techniques.\n\nCurator: Mark Wong, Ujikaji \nMark Wong conceived Ujikaji as an independent music label and organiser of DIY music events. Ujikaji means “experiment” in Malay, and the label’s interests lie in the curation of experimental music, with a special focus on Southeast Asian artists and sounds. The label supports independent artists with platforms to perform their music, as well as in producing and releasing their music, and establishing a complementary partnership that allows them to focus on the creative aspects of music-making. Ujikaji has released works by Magus (Leslie Low and Mark Dolmont), Dream State Vision (Shaun Sankaran), Awk Wah (Shark Fung), The Observatory, Pan Gu (Leslie Low and Lasse Marhaug) and Tim O’Dwyer.",

Booking through ShakaPass does not guarantee a seat/standing space but will help to facilitate crowd expectation.\n\nLi Shuen\nA classically-trained pianist, Li Shuen blew us away with her four-track EP Loose Glitter, one of our favourite discoveries of 2015. Her playing is tender but royal, romantic but distant, a Ryuichi Sakamoto concert described in a Murakami novel. “no beginning, no end”, a quarter of an hour of piano improvisation, recalls Keith Jarrett’s Köln Concert but less mawkishly so. Ujikaji is delighted to present Li Shuen in her debut solo performance.\n\nCurator: Mark Wong, Ujikaji \nMark Wong conceived Ujikaji as an independent music label and organiser of DIY music events.

Booking through ShakaPass does not guarantee a seat/standing space but will help to facilitate crowd expectation.\n\nKotoKottoN is a koto (Japanese zither) ensemble from the National University of Singapore. It was established in 2009 by Ms Kitai Saeko, a qualified koto teacher from the Sawai Koto School, Japan.\n\nThe name of the ensemble combines the instrument and the Japanese onomatopoeia “kotton” for the sound of moving along. KotoKottoN has gone from small-scale performances in the university, such as the annual Japanese Cultural Night, to larger performances such as the Japanese Emperor's Birthday Reception. The ensemble was also involved in the International Koto Festival 2013 in Sydney, Australia.\n\nThe ensemble uses the standard 13-stringed koto and the 17-stringed bass koto to play a variety of music ranging from traditional pieces to contemporary arrangements.",

Booking through ShakaPass does not guarantee a seat/standing space but will help to facilitate crowd expectation.\n\nThe ritualistic ceremonies of the Afro-Brazilian candomblé religion have distinctly shaped the musical soundscape of Brazil, influencing many contemporary styles. Not only can it be heard in the temples but also in the vibrant and colourful carnival settings and stages across Brazil. Journey into a world of Brazilian music and the vivacious Brazilian life spirit through songs and grooves derived from the sacred traditions of Candomblé.\n\nAlafia is an intercultural project between master drummer Dudu Tucci (Sao Paulo/Berlin) and Bloco Singapura, featuring the enchanting voice of Mariana Viana (Salvador, Bahia).",

Their performances range from strong and powerful pieces produced by DANROK—a Japanese Niibori all-male sextet touted as one of the marquee guitar ensemble groups in the world—to sentimental pieces like the wistful Gelsominia; the riveting Tokyo Bay Highway; and Hotaru, the theme song of popular movie The Eternal Zero. Fans of Japanese pop culture can anticipate the performance of Unknown Bad Spacetime, while anime lovers can feast their ears on A Town with an Ocean View from Studio Ghibli’s Kiki’s Delivery Service. Hwa Chong Guitar Ensemble promises a night to remember.\n\nAbout Hwa Chong Guitar Ensemble\n\nAlbeit a young CCA, Hwa Chong Guitar Ensemble (HCGE) is proud to have grown from a full prime guitar club, to a recognised Niibori Guitar Ensemble comprising five sections (alto 1, alto 2, prime, bass, contrabass and guitarron). This allows members to explore varying shades and tonalities through a special set of Niibori guitars with varying pitch. The aim is to teach students classical guitar techniques, as well as to increase their interest in the instrument and boost their confidence in performing as an ensemble. The ensemble aspires to become an outstanding group, and strives for musical excellence and holistic development of its students through a multitude of enriching activities.\n\nEvent is 30mins.",

Booking through ShakaPass does not guarantee a seat/standing space but will help to facilitate crowd expectation.\n\nWith outlandish costumes, nostalgic music, and larger-than-life performers, every chindonya show is bound to bring joy and laughter. Originally a form of street advertising that originated in the Edo period, performers were musicians engaged to promote products in the streets. Unique to chindonya is a three-in-one instrument called the chindon, which is made up of two drums and a gong. Together with another drum, a clarinet, and a saxophone are also used. Look forward to these traditional Japanese street performances by The Adachi Company!",

So far.\n\nJust prior to that Harith embarked on a six-nation comedy tour titled “The Godfather of Malaysian Stand Up Comedy International Tour” where he performed to audiences in India (Chennai/New Delhi), Korea (Seoul), Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia (Perth) and Indonesia (Jakarta).\n",

Booking through ShakaPass does not guarantee a seat/standing space but will help to facilitate crowd expectation.\n\nIn Japan, the carp is a symbol of courage, strength, and success, because of its ability to swim upstream. According to one legend, a carp swam against the current to become a dragon. Since the Edo period, the Japanese have been putting up koinobori, or carp streamers, as a spring tradition to wish all children good health and happiness. It is also a sign of hope for them to bear the traits of the carp.\n\nUsing stamps and paint, come transform a plain cloth into a koinobori that is uniquely yours!",
